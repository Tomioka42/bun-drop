That will take you to a page where you can enter your information and choose if you want to pay with Card or Swish. When you're all done with entering all the information required you can press Pay. This will take you to the confirmation page. There you will want to press the Exit button to Exit the confirmation page and you will be sent to the home page. Then you are free to close the browser if you feel like you are done or continue checking the app out.


#Getting the app started

When you first open the app in Visual studio code.

Start by opening the terminal by pressing "ctrl + รถ". When the terminal has opened you can type "npm run json-server" then hit "Enter". This will start the Db.json server that has the menu in it. (Note: If this step is not done the app will not work like it's suppose to)

After the server has started you can open another terminal with the "+" icon to the right of the terminal. This will open another terminal and there you will want to type "npm start" to start the application. This will open a window in your browser (like Google chrome or firefox). When the browser have been open you can start using the application.

Now you are all set to use the application.
